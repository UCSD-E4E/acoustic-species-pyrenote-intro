# Task 1: Create New Users
Once you have opened the site on the browser of your choice, the first thing you will see if a login page. This has already been done for you. Instead what we need is the ability for new users (perhaps people are sharing the same device and want to annotate separate projects). Luckily someone has already gone through half of it and finished the backend, but didn't finish the frontend side (as you can see if you press the create new user button at the bottom of the page). Your Frist task is to finish the frontend for the create user site.

## You must do the following:

 Add text boxes for password and a confirm password section
- Figure out how to stop the user form uploading the password if the passwords don't match in either text box you make
- finsh the Axios method for handling the uploading part on the frontend side.

**Hints**
- If you need to use print statements, use console.log. Then right-click on your browser to open up the inspect tool. Here you can see the various elements of the website and open up the console on the frontend. Try planning around with it has it is a pretty useful tool for debugging. 
- Feel free to look up documentation, check out pyrenote, or use reference code to solve this and future problems!
